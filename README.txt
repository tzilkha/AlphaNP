The current implementation is all in a jupyter notebook for ease of
tweaking. Will soon be updated into multiple organized classes once code
structure works.

Currently MCTS works with a neural net . Implemented a CNN. From preliminary
examination seems that CNN does not speed up. Next step is to try GNN for
TSP.

Planning on implementing LSTM and more NP Problems.
